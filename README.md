# Applied Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Applied Machine Learning repository! This project is dedicated to implementing various machine learning algorithms and techniques on real-world datasets to solve practical problems. Our aim is to provide clear, reproducible examples and explanations that help both beginners and experienced practitioners enhance their machine learning skills.

## Contents

- **Datasets**: This folder contains datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- **Notebooks**: This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks with detailed analyses, visualizations, and implementation of machine learning models.
- **Scripts**: This folder contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **Models**: This folder contains serialized machine learning models for deployment and inference.
