    "## Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will focus on acquiring the dataset and preparing it for analysis. Proper data preprocessing is crucial for building an effective predictive model. The tasks involved in this step are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Load the Dataset\n",
    "- **Description**: Import the dataset into the environment. This can be done using libraries like Pandas to read data from CSV files, databases, or other data sources.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Ensure that the dataset is successfully loaded and ready for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Handle Missing Values\n",
    "- **Description**: Identify and handle any missing or null values in the dataset. This can be done through various strategies such as removing rows with missing values, imputing with mean/median/mode, or using more advanced techniques.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Ensure the dataset is complete and does not have any gaps that could negatively impact the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- **Description**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features. This includes generating summary statistics, visualizing data distributions, and identifying patterns or anomalies.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Gain insights into the data, which can help in making informed decisions during feature selection and model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Encode Categorical Variables\n",
    "- **Description**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or binary encoding. This step is essential because most machine learning algorithms require numerical input.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Transform categorical data into a format suitable for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Scale Numerical Features\n",
    "- **Description**: Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure that they have a consistent scale. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling and Standard scaling.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Improve the performance of the machine learning algorithms by ensuring that features contribute equally to the distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Step 1, we should have a clean, well-structured dataset that is ready for feature selection and model training. This foundational work is crucial for building an accurate and reliable housing price predictor."
